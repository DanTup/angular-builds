AngularJS Builds
==============

This repo is a mirror of the AngularJS build outputs. As there are no official npm modules for Angular, I wanted a convenient way to manage Angular used for testing (with Karma) in my repos without committing the whole thing. Since my repo was already friendly to ```npm install``` after a clean clone, a Git repo seemed like an easy way to do it.

To install Angular via npm, execute:

    npm install angular-builds
